How to update robosim to for the new roboplay challenge year:

Changes need to be made in a couple places to get the newest year of the
RoboPlay challenge included within the program.  First the challenges are in a
folder in the librs repository under resources/challenges.  These are xml files
for each challenge named the same as the challenge names used within the
RoboSim GUI.  The GUI will search for these files by name.  The background
board is in the librs repo under the resources/background directory.  Code
changes are relatively simple and done within the following commits for the
2017 board and challenges:

librs: 3db662ab70b18e83c98128e9fa10ef0c9cd322a8 - add new 2017 background board files
librs: 30e146b344e9a9602ea1dce39885eda0543f97b3 - add new 2017 challenge files
RoboSim: 7fbc286717db4342e79d662e5d1151651722a87b - add 2017 RoboPlay into GUI list of backgrounds
RoboSim: 7756f7af265218fab94deaf3deae539fb1f5fc4c - add new challenges to the GUI challenge tree

All changes are done within these four commits.  There are no extraneous
changes in these commits which are not necessary for the addition of the files.
Most of the changes are adding the files and then referencing them in the right
place within the code.

Happy Editing
